# Hi, I'm Mohamed Oun

Software engineer in Berlin. I build tools that help me (and others) make better decisions — usually by surfacing the right data at the right time.

## What I'm working on

### [SquadStat](https://squadstat.com) — Football Scouting Dashboards

Comprehensive scouting tool built on Transfermarkt data. Covers club form analysis, player exploration, value efficiency, and injury impact — all in interactive dashboards with shareable filtered views.

### [Topcasts](https://github.com/Mohamed3on/Topcasts-web) — Podcast Discovery

A Next.js app for discovering and tracking the best podcast episodes, with community-driven ratings and reviews.

### [NutriData](https://github.com/Mohamed3on/NutriData) — Nutritional Insights for Online Grocery Shopping

Chrome extension (170+ commits) that surfaces protein-per-euro, NutriScore, and other key nutritional metrics directly on product pages and search results on Rewe.de and Amazon. Makes healthy choices effortless.

## Browser Extensions — Better Scores Everywhere

I believe most platforms do a poor job of presenting ratings. I've built a collection of browser extensions that fix this by computing and displaying more meaningful scores:

| Extension | What it does |
|---|---|
| [**Google Maps Reviews Summarizer**](https://github.com/Mohamed3on/summarize-google-maps-reviews) | Distills reviews into a single quality score, filtering out fake accounts, with time-based trends |
| [**Amazon Scores**](https://github.com/Mohamed3on/showAmazonScores) | Shows adjusted rating scores on Amazon product pages |
| [**Amazon Sort by Rating**](https://github.com/Mohamed3on/Amazon-sort-by-rating) | Actually sorts Amazon results by meaningful rating |
| [**Letterboxd Score**](https://github.com/Mohamed3on/showLetterBoxdScore) | Displays computed scores on Letterboxd |
| [**IMDB Custom Score**](https://github.com/Mohamed3on/Show-IMDB-custom-score) | Shows a custom weighted score on IMDB pages |
| [**Goodreads Book Score**](https://github.com/Mohamed3on/custom-goodreads-book-score-extension) | Custom book scoring on Goodreads |
| [**Booking.com Sort by Score**](https://github.com/Mohamed3on/Booking-sort-by-score) | Sorts Booking.com results by review score |
| [**Airbnb Score Calculator**](https://github.com/Mohamed3on/airbnb-score-calculator) | Calculates a better score for Airbnb listings |
| [**Decathlon/Uniqlo/IKEA NPS Score**](https://github.com/Mohamed3on/decathlon-nps-score) | Adds NPS-style scores to retail product pages |
| [**TripAdvisor Review Count**](https://github.com/Mohamed3on/tripAdvisor-number-of-reviews) | Shows review counts on TripAdvisor listings |
| [**Transfermarkt Table Sorter**](https://github.com/Mohamed3on/TransfermarktTableSorter) | Makes any table on Transfermarkt sortable |
